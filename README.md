# Iterative Projection and Matching
implementation of the data selection algorithm proposed in: 

Alireza Zaeemzadeh, Mohsen Joneidi ( shared first authorship) , Nazanin Rahnavard, Mubarak Shah: Iterative Projection and Matching: Finding Structure-preserving Representatives and Its Application to Computer Vision. IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

- For a quick demo using MNIST, please run `python demo.py`.
## Requirements
